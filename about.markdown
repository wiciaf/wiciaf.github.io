## Research
--------------
The focus of my research is to examine interpersonal connections across social divides as valuable resources to improve psychological and material well-being. I aim to integrate social and behavioral science research into policy and practice.

## Outside of Academia
---------------
My non-academic goals include writing and illustrating a children's book, going whale watching in Alaska, and living on a farm (but just for a little while).
